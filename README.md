# AI Document Analyzer üìÑ‚ú®

**AI Document Analyzer** is a comprehensive, interactive, and purely client-side web application designed for summarizing and analyzing text documents. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages various frontend libraries to offer a rich set of features without requiring any backend processing, ensuring user data remains private and secure within the browser.

This tool serves as an impressive demonstration of what can be achieved with modern web technologies for NLP tasks, data parsing, and visualization, all within a single-file architecture.

    *   **Key Concept Extraction:** Identifies and displays the most relevant terms and concepts.
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Basic regex-based extraction of common entities (Persons, Organizations, Dates, Locations, Misc).
    *   **Document Insights:**
        *   Readability Score (Flesch-like).
        *   Overall Sentiment Analysis (lexicon-based).
        *   Text Statistics (word count, sentence count, average words per sentence).
*   **Interactive User Interface:**
    *   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.
    *   **Light/Dark Theme Toggle:** For user comfort.
    *   **Tabbed Layout:** Organizes input, settings, and various analysis results clearly.
    *   **Real-time Word Count:** As you type.
    *   **Loading Indicators & Progress Bars:** For a smooth user experience during processing.
*   **Data Visualization:**
    *   **Entity Distribution Chart:** Bar chart (via Chart.js) showing the frequency of different named entity types.
    *   (D3.js included for potential future advanced visualizations like word clouds or network graphs).
*   **Utility Features:**
    *   **In-Document Search:** Find specific terms within the original text with context.
    *   **Copy & Download:** Easily copy summaries or download them as `.txt` files.
    *   **Export All Results:** Download a comprehensive analysis report.
    *   **Processing History:** Saves recent analyses in `localStorage` for quick reloading.
*   **Client-Side Processing:**
    *   **Privacy-Focused:** All analysis happens directly in the user's browser. No data is sent to any server.
    *   **Offline Capable:** Once loaded, the application can function offline (for text input).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Machine Learning (Utility/Placeholder):** [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) (included, not heavily used for complex model inference in this version)
*   **Charting:** [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for entity distribution visualization.
*   **Advanced Visualization (Foundation):** [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) included for potential future graphical representations.
*   **CSV Parsing:** [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) for handling `.csv` files.
*   **Excel Parsing:** [SheetJS (js-xlsx)](https://sheetjs.com/) for reading `.xlsx` and `.xls` files.
*   **(Future) PDF Parsing:** Structure in place to integrate [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) if added via CDN.

## üí° How It Works (Simplified AI)

The "AI" capabilities in this application are primarily implemented using:

1.  **Algorithmic NLP:**
    *   **Summarization:** Sentence scoring based on word frequencies (TextRank-like) and positional heuristics.
    *   **Key Concept Extraction:** Identifying high-frequency content words after stop-word removal.
2.  **Rule-Based Systems:**
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Regular expressions are used to find common patterns for dates, emails, and rudimentary person/organization mentions.
3.  **Lexicon-Based Analysis:**
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Comparing words against predefined lists of positive and negative terms.
4.  **Statistical Methods:**
    *   **Readability & Text Stats:** Applying formulas (like a simplified Flesch score) and basic counting.

This approach allows for a feature-rich experience entirely within the browser, demonstrating fundamental NLP concepts without the overhead of large, pre-trained deep learning models.

## üîß Usage

1.  **No Installation Needed:** Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari recommended).
2.  **Input Text:**
    *   Type or paste text directly into the "Text Input" area.
    *   Switch to the "File Upload" tab to drag-and-drop or browse for `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or `.html` files.
3.  **Configure Settings (Optional):**
    *   Adjust the desired **Summary Length** percentage.
    *   Set the maximum number of **Key Concepts** to extract.
    *   Choose the **Summary Type** (Extractive, Simplified "Abstractive", Bullet Points).
    *   Toggle options for **Extracting Named Entities** and **Calculating Document Insights**.
4.  **Analyze:**
    *   Click the "Analyze & Summarize" button.
5.  **View Results:**
    *   Navigate through the output tabs (Summary, Key Entities, Insights, Search Document) to explore the analysis.
    *   Interact with the entity chart.
    *   Use the search bar to find terms in your original document.
6.  **Manage & Export:**
    *   Copy or download the generated summary.
    *   Export a full text report of all analysis results.
    *   Access recently processed documents from the History section.
